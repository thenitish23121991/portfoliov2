How App works
<div class="title_seperator"></div>
</div>
<div class="works_content_text" id="works_content_text3">
Crosschecks is designed to prevent the theft of vehicles from housing societies in New Delhi. These societies are particularly vulnerable during night. The App is designed for Guards, Car Owners and Police Officials. The Guards use the app to ensure that the vehicles leaving and arriving at the society are of valid owners. They generate an OTP for that particular car and then match that with the OTP received by the driver. If the OTP is not matched, the Guard contacts the vehicle owner and verifies the identity of the driver.
</div>


<div class="works_content_title">
For Police Officials
<div class="title_seperator"></div>
</div>
<div class="works_content_text" id="works_content_text3">
The Police officials use the app to get a dynamic list of all the vehicles reported stolen in their designated area. With a list of details about the vehicles stolen, the officials can perform a check on any suspicious vehicle they find, much like guards. They also generate an OTP and confirm it with the driver of the vehicle. If the OTP is not matched, the police official establish contact with the designated police station.
</div>



<div class="works_content_title">
For Vehicle Owners
<div class="title_seperator"></div>
</div>
<div class="works_content_text" id="works_content_text3">
The vehicle owner is requested to upload their vehicle details on the app and keep them updated. The owner also uploads the details of the his/her family on the app. Every member of a family is assumed as an owner of all the vehicles of the family.
</div>


<div class="works_content_title">
For Vehicle Owners
<div class="title_seperator"></div>
</div>
<div class="works_content_text" id="works_content_text3">
When an OTP is generated by a guard or a police official, the same OTP is sent to the owners of the vehicle.

Assuming that you have an account (sign up if you don't), let's install the Heroku Client for the command-line. Heroku offers a Mac OS X installer, the Heroku Toolbelt, that includes the client. But for these kind of tools, I prefer using Homebrew. It allows us to keep better track of what we have installed. Luckily for us, Homebrew includes a heroku-toolbelt formula:
